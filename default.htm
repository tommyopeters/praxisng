This is Default Page of Your Website

Please upload your index page file as index.html or index.php via FTP.
So you will overwrite on this file.

If this page is still available after you upload your index file, please check the suffix of your file.
This service shows index.htm first when both index.html and index.htm or index.php are available.

NOTE: If you want to use index.htm or index.php, please remove this default file, index.html.
